# Pomodoro.sh 


I made my own version for a terminal pomodoro as I'm using bash instead of zsh


Inspired by bashbunni on youtube

You will need to have this timer installed:

If you want sound with the notification, uncomment these lines (lines 26 and 32): paplay ~/Music/soft.wav

and you can put your path to the sound file that you want to play. Make sure it's converted to a .wav file

If you don't care about the interface of pom.sh, pom2.sh is more minimal and can be executed straight from the command line.
