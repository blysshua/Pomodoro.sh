I made my own version for a terminal pomodoro as I'm using bash instead of zsh

You will need to have this timer installed: 
https://github.com/caarlos0/timer?tab=readme-ov-file

If you want sound with the notification, uncomment these lines: paplay ~/Music/soft.wav
and you can put your path to the sound file you want to play. Make sure it's converted to a .wav file
